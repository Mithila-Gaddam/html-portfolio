<h1>The Best Drama Series According to Mithila</h1>
<h2>My top 3 dramas of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>I Am Not A Robot</h3>
<p>My second drama I have watched and it's a great Rom-Com out there.</p>
<h3>All Of Us Are Dead</h3>
<p>
  A Zombie thriller. It makes us sit on the edge all the time almost. Can't wait
  for Season 2 to be OUTTT.
</p>
<h3>My Demon</h3>
<p>
  Trust me when I say, IT HAS GOT THE BEST OST. Pretty Scenes, Wonderful
  Protogonists. Its literally a fairy tale kind of Series.
